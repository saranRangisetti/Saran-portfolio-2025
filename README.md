# Sai Saran Rangisetti - Portfolio

A comprehensive portfolio showcasing professional experience, technical expertise, and innovative projects in AI, machine learning, and full-stack development.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio represents my journey as a business-driven full-stack engineer who builds applications that transform how teams operate. With hands-on experience across front-end (React/Redux), back-end (Python/Django, Java), databases, and AWS cloud, I deliver end-to-end solutions that connect technology to real business value.

From designing AI chatbots that automate complex workflows to developing analytics platforms that empower smarter decisions, this portfolio demonstrates my ability to thrive in fast-moving, high-growth environments where I can own initiatives and make an immediate impact.
